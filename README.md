# TrafficAlert
IOS mobile application that alerts you when the traffic time to reach your destination is optimal!

Unfortunately the developer that was working on the web side of this app did not complete the api for the mobile to call, 
so it's currently not functional.

There are some good examples of using MapKit, and its MKLocalSearchRequest library for autocompleting place names when searching.
